# 3py
 A simple python-based CAD software

I'm kinda learning python as I do this, so it'll probably suck a bit.

to run, you need to have pygame, openGL, ctypes, pyrr, and numPy installed on your system. Of course, you also need to have Python installed :)

you can easily install most of those libraries with the pip command on Windows or the I don't fucking know command on Linux

Load primitives by editing the python script at line 36

Why not drop in your own!?
